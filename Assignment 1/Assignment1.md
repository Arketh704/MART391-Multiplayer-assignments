MART391 Assignment 1 -  Multiplayer Game's


First Game : Betrayal at house on the hill

  1. What type of multiplayer game was it?

      Betrayal at house on the hill is a multiplayer board game that can have 3 to 6 players. The basic rundown is every player chooses a characters, each of them have their own stats and speed. The characters moves on their turn to explore different parts of the house. When a player enters a door that has no room placed behind it. They must place one and if that card has a respective icon such as an Omen, Item or Event. They must follow suit with what the card says, giving you and item or causing an event but if you pull an omen card, you cause a haunt to happen which turns your charcter into a monster for the rest of the players to stop. Its either you win by taking out the players or them taking you out. 

  2. What part of the games were you most drawn to?

      The reason I was drawn to this game is because of how competitive and intense it can be when played with the right people. When you and your friends are all still in the beginning its fun to see who gets turned into the monster and even more fun when everyone is running around the house together, trying to figure out how to defeat the monster. Its makes for some pretty hectic games when everyone is so focused on winning. 

  3. What types of information must be saved along the way?

      Some of the kinds of information you have to remember along the way would be things like items you have, event rooms, how to defeat the different monsters, room locations and holes in the floor that drop you to lower floors, Secret scenarios 

  4. Did you have to depend on the other player?  If so, in what capacity and how did they help you?

      If you didnt get turned into the monster, you and your friends have to rely on each other heavily to win the game because the monster becomes more of a threat the longer he stays around. You and your friends have to either find certain items or complete a ritual in order to destroy the monster and each monster varies in ways to destroy it so teamwork is paramount for success 


Second game : Escape from Tarkov 


1. What type of multiplayer game was it?

    Escape from Tarkov is a first person hardcore extraction shooter. You play as a PMC thats been left in an ongoing warzone to fend for yourself. Your objective like the name is to escape tarkov by any means neccessary. The gameplay consists of making your way through the different maps and completing raids. You'll go into each map bringing a set of gear from your own stash, you can lose this gear at anytime whether its from being killed by another player or AI or just even getting killed by a stray round. You're able to loot a plethora of containers looking for valuables or weapons to take back to your hideout. 

2. What part of the games were you most drawn to?

    The part of the game that I'm most drawn to is the survival/hardcore aspects of the game. Such aspects would be things like losing progress on death, needing to give youself medical attention after a fight, fighting other players, getting out of a raid with a lot of gear. The list could go on and on but those are just a few of the things i really love about this game. Its much more realistic than most other games of its type but i think thats also why i like it more. its not like those other games, its, its own things.

3. What types of information must be saved along the way?

    The amount of information that needs to be remembered in tarkov is out of this world, it has one of the highest skill ceilings ive seen in a game when it comes to information and knowledge about the game. Some of the things you need to remember are things like where quests are located and where they want you to go because there are no map markers or even a map, you must read the quest log to figure it out, Remembering where all the extraction points are to leave the map, keeping an eye on your food and water levels so you dont die of dehydration or fatigue, general map navigation, 

4. Did you have to depend on the other player?  If so, in what capacity and how did they help you?

    Not entirely but they do help when they are around. Tarkov is a game that can be played completely solo or with friends. While playing solo is generally a little more difficult because you dont have anyone watching your back. When they do help they basically are only used for watching other points of interest for enemies or helping you snipe by being your spotter. other players do help in the long run but arent required to truly enjoy the game
